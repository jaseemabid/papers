# A Schemer's View of Monads

This is a Monad tutorial assuming knowledge of functions as values and a reading
knowledge of Scheme. Notably, the authors do not assume a reading knowledge of
types.

I fail to see how reading this paper is better than the reading the
[original, Monads for functional programming](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf)
by Wadler.
